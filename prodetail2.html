        Project Title: Optimizing Credit Scoring with Reinforcement Learning
    </h2>
    <b>Project Overview:</b>
<pre>
This project focuses on improving traditional credit scoring systems using Reinforcement Learning 
(RL) techniques.
Credit scoring is a crucial process used by banks and financial institutions to assess a person’s 
creditworthiness — whether they are likely to repay a loan or not.
Unlike static machine learning models, this project applies RL to dynamically learn the best 
decision policies based on reward and penalty feedback, optimizing loan approvals and reducing default risks.
</pre>
<b>Objectives:</b>
<pre>
To design an AI-driven model that optimizes lending decisions over time.

To minimize loan defaults while maximizing profit and fairness.

To demonstrate how Reinforcement Learning can outperform traditional rule-based or supervised approaches in credit scoring.
</pre>
<b>Tools and Technologies Used:</b>
<pre>
  <b>Programming Language:</b> Python

Libraries:

TensorFlow / Keras – to build and train neural network agents

NumPy & Pandas – for data handling and numerical analysis

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for visualization

Scikit-learn – for comparison with traditional models

RL Algorithm: Q-Learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN)

Dataset: Credit scoring dataset from Kaggle or UCI Repository (containing customer financial data such as income, balance, and loan history).
</pre>

<h3>Working Process / Implementation Steps:</h3>
<li>
    <ol>
        <li>Data Preprocessing:
            <ul>
                <li>Collected a dataset containing customer information (age, income, loan amount, repayment history, etc.).</li>
                <li>Cleaned and normalized the data for better model performance.</li>
                <li>Split the data into training and testing sets.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Environment Design (Reinforcement Setup):
            <ul>
                <li>Defined each state as a customer’s financial profile.</li>
                <li>Defined each action as a possible decision:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Approve Loan</li>
                        <li>Reject Loan</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Designed a reward function:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Positive reward (+1 or profit) for correctly approving a trustworthy borrower.</li>
                        <li>Negative reward (−1 or loss) for approving a risky borrower.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>3. Model Training (Learning Phase):
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented Q-Learning / Deep Q-Network (DQN) to train the agent.</li>
                <li>The agent learns from experience:
                    <ul>
                        <li>If approving a loan leads to repayment → reward.</li>
                        <li>If it leads to default → penalty.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Model Evaluation:
            <ul>
                <li>Compared RL results with traditional supervised models (like logistic regression or random forest).</li>
                <li>Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for decision quality.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Visualization & Results:
            <ul>
                <li>Plotted training rewards over episodes to show learning progress.</li>
                <li>Visualized confusion matrix and ROC curves for performance evaluation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
</li>
<h3>Results:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Reinforcement Learning achieved higher decision efficiency by dynamically adapting to new data.</li>
    <li>The model reduced loan default rates and improved profit margins compared to static models.</li>
    <li>Demonstrated how RL can make financial systems more adaptive, data-driven, and intelligent.</li>
